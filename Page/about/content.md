## About Me

Hello, my name is **Joseph Delgado**. I'm a software engineer based out of New Jersey.

I'm a **full-stack web developer** by trade, but I have a strong and varied skill set. I catalog some of my **personal projects** on this blog, feel free to check it out!

In addition to programming, I also enjoy rock climbing, backpacking, and ultimate frisbee.
