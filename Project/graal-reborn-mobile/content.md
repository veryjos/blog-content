## graal-reborn-mobile

A mobile client for **Graal Reborn**. Uses [OpenGS1](https://github.com/veryjos/OpenGS1) (my open-source reimplementation of the GS1 scripting language) to maintain **binary compatibility** with the **Graal Online 2.17** client.

Built as part of a larger project called **Graal Reborn** which I contributed to for many years.

Written in **C++17** with **SDL** and **OpenGL ES 2.0**.
