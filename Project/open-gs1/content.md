GS1 is a **scripting language from 1999** used in the game **Graal Online**. Graal Online was my favorite game growing up, and I wanted to help preserve some of the game's rich history.

**OpenGS1 reimplements** GS1 for the purposes of **preservation**.

### OpenGS1 Features:
  - **Source compatible** with Graal 2.17
  - Stack-based virtual machine
  - Portable bytecode format
  - Simple embedding API
  - Emscripten-based web playground

This was made for **Graal Reborn**- a **preservation project** for **Graal Online**. Graal Reborn reverse engineers and reimplements Graal Online's server, such that users can host their own private servers. Being able to interpret GS1 opens many new doors for Graal Reborn.

Written in dependency-free **C++14**.
