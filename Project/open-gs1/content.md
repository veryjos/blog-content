A **source-compatible** reimplementation of Graal's GS1 scripting language.

This was made for **Graal Reborn**, which is a reimplementation project for **Graal Online**'s legacy clients.

**OpenGS1** seeks to reimplement GS1 in a source-compatible way, such that scripts made for the game Graal Online can be preserved. Most of the language has been implemented. Some fringe features that aren't frequently used by the community have been omitted for the sake of delivering an MVP.

Written in **C++14**.
