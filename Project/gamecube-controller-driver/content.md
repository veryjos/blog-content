## gamecube-controller-driver

A **libusb driver** for the **WUP-028** (official GameCube controller adapter from Nintendo).

This is mostly a reverse engineering and **libusb driver** implementation of the protocol used by the device, so you can use the adapter in your own projects.

Currently in use by multiple games in development.

Built with **Rust** with idiomatic **C# bindings** (for some Unity games).
