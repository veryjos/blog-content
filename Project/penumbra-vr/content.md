The [HPL Engine ](https://github.com/FrictionalGames/HPL1Engine) is **open source** and **Penumbra: Overture** is one of my favorite games, so I added **VR support** a few summers ago.

### Features

  - Head tracking with **6 degrees of freedom**
  - Hand tracking with robust physics interactions
  - Stereoscopic 3D rendering
  - A **new tutorial** for VR players
  - Joystick or teleport locomotion
  - Supersampling for increased clarity
  - VR-friendly menus

Written in **C++** with **OpenVR** and **Direct3D 9**. **RenderDoc** was used extensively to debug stereo rendering issues.
