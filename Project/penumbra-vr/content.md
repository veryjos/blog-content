## Penumbra: VR

A fork of **Penumbra: Overture** ([HPL Engine](https://github.com/FrictionalGames/HPL1Engine) by [Frictional Games](https://frictionalgames.com/)) to add **virtual reality** support.

Features:

  - Head tracking with **6 degrees of freedom**
  - Hand tracking with robust physics interactions
  - Stereoscopic 3D rendering
  - A **new tutorial** for VR players
  - Joystick-based or teleport locomotion
  - VR-friendly menus
  - Supersampling for increased clarity

Written in **C++** with **OpenVR** and **Direct3D 9**. **RenderDoc** was used to debug lots of stereoscopic rendering related features.
