After the **HPL Engine** went [open source](https://github.com/FrictionalGames/HPL1Engine), I decided to add **VR support** to **Penumbra: Overture**. It's one of my favorite games!

### Features

  - Stereoscopic 3D rendering
  - Head tracking with 6 degrees of freedom
  - Hand tracking with robust physics interactions
  - Joystick or teleport locomotion
  - Supersampled rendering
  - A VR-centric tutorial
  - VR-friendly menus

Written in **C++** with **OpenVR** and **Direct3D 9**. **RenderDoc** was used extensively to reverse engineer the renderer and add stereo rendering.
