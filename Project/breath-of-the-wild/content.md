## breath-of-the-wild

A **reverse engineering** of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the WiiU.

Me and my friend [Matt](https://handsomematt.co.uk") reverse engineered a bunch of binary formats and other information about Breath of the Wild on the WiiU.

My major contributions include:

  - Reverse engineering the binary world format
  - Creating [tools to rip world data](https://github.com/veryjos/botw_sig_revenge) out of the game's archive formats.
  - Creating tools to visualize the world in [2D](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11465187/32668981-13f89c22-c60d-11e7-9bd2-a6e373cd7a7b.png) and [3D](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11465187/32668718-5a8a0d7a-c60c-11e7-818e-83a19390da97.png)

I also ran a club on campus called **SIG: REVENGE** (Special Interest Group: Reverse Engineering) where this was a primary project.

This repo was used as a reference by other authors to create projects like [IceSpear](https://ice-spear-tools.gitlab.io/).

Tooling was written in **Python** and **C#**.
